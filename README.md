**Design:** 

The House Price Predictor application is built on a modular and maintainable architecture that emphasizes scalability and reliability. 

- **Data Collection Module (script.py):** 
- We used undetected\_chromedriver, selenium and csv libraries for web scraping and data saving. 
- We retrieve the region, gross, number of rooms, price and neighborhood data of houses in the districts of Istanbul from sahibinden.com with the script.py file and store this data as a csv file (1969 data).  
- Then we extract "TL" from the price values in the dataset and convert it to a float value, and clean the empty or missing rows from the dataset.  
- Then we determine the parameters for our models. These are: 
- X (independent variables): 
  - gross(m^2) 
  - number of rooms 
  - region (converted to binary value with one-hot encoding) 
- Y (dependent variable): 
- price(TL) 
- **Models Module (models.py):** 
- Machine learning tools implementation:** 
- Linear Regression:  Assumes a linear relationship  between features  and target; simple and interpretable. 
- Random  Forest:  Uses  multiple  decision  trees  to  improve  accuracy  and reduce overfitting; handles non-linear relationships well. 
- SVR (Support Vector Regression): Fits data within a margin; effective in high-dimensional spaces; requires feature scaling. 
- Gradient Boosting Regression: Sequentially builds trees to correct errors; captures complex patterns but can overfit. 
- XGBoost: An efficient, regularized version of gradient boosting; excels in performance and scalability. 
- We train our models with the data we have prepared. Then we save models to house\_price\_models.pkl file with pickle liblary. Then we evaluate the results of these models. 
- For evaluation: 
- Cross-validation 
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 
- R^2 Score 
- models testing 
- By comparing the obtained metrics, we show the best performing model. 
- **Visualization Modules (gui\_visualization.py, price\_map\_visualizer.py):** 
- Geographic price distribution mapping. 
- Statistical charts and graphs. 
- PDF export functionality. 
- **Prediction module (gui\_prediction.py):** 
- User input handling. 
- Statistical analysis of predictions. 
- Real-time price predictions. 
- **Performance Metrics (gui\_metrics.py):** 
- Model performance visualization. 
- performance dashboards. 
- **Technical Features:** 
- Python-based implementation. 
- Tkinter for GUI development. 
- Scikit-learn for machine learning. 
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. 
- Selenium for data collection. 
- Pandas for data manipulation. 

This modular design ensures scalability for new features, easy maintenance, robustness and clear separation of concerns.

**Methodology:** 

The Istanbul House Price Prediction and Visualization System project was carried out using a systematic approach, incorporating various processes, tools, and techniques to achieve the desired outcomes. Below is a detailed methodology: 

1. **Processes:** 
- Data was collected from sahibinden.com, a popular Turkish real estate website, using web scraping tools. 
- The script.py file leveraged Selenium and undetected\_chromedriver for dynamic content scraping. 
- Collected data (region, gross area, number of rooms, price, neighborhood) was stored in a csv file format for further processing. 
- The data cleaning process involved converting price data from string to float, removing missing or empty rows and applying one-hot encoding to transform categorical data. 
- Independent variables (X) included gross (m²), number of rooms, and region, while the dependent variable (Y) was price (TL). 
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** 
- Several  machine learning algorithms  were implemented in  the models.py file. These  are  Linear  Regression,  Random  Forest  Regression,  Support  Vector Regression,  Gradient Boosting Regression and XGBoost models. 
- Each  model  was  evaluated  using  Cross-validation,  Root  Mean  Square  Error (RMSE), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and R^2 Score metrics. 
- The models saved as a house\_price\_models.pkl file using the pickle library. 
3. **Tools and Techniques:** 
- **Programming Language and Libraries:** 
- Python served as the primary language for development. 
- Key libraries used: 
- Selenium: Dynamic web scraping. 
- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing. 
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning model implementation. 
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization. 
- Geopandas and Folium: Geographic data visualization. 
- Tkinter: Graphical User Interface (GUI) development. 
4. **Visualization Tools:** 
- The application featured statistical charts and graphs for price distribution, geographic maps showing price trends by district and pdf export functionality for visualized results. 
5. **User Interface Development:** 
- The GUI, implemented using Tkinter, allowed users to input property details, generate real-time  price  predictions,  view  interactive  performance  dashboards  and visualizations. 
6. **Technical Procedures:** 
- Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve model accuracy. 
- The gui\_metrics.py module provided dashboards displaying model evaluation metrics and comparisons. 
- The project was divided into modules for better maintainability and scalability. 

This methodology ensured a structured approach to data collection, processing, model implementation, visualization, and user interaction, resulting in a comprehensive and scalable solution for house price prediction application. 

**Implementation and Analysis:** 

1. **Execution of Design and Methodology:** 
- Data Collection: Used Selenium to scrape data (region, gross area, rooms, price) from sahibinden.com, stored in a CSV file, cleaned, and preprocessed (one-hot encoding and converting price values from string to float and removing “TL”). 
- Model Training: Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting, and  XGBoost  models  using  models.py.  Models  were  evaluated  with  metrics  like RMSE, MAE, and R², and saved as house\_price\_models.pkl. 
- Visualization: Used Geopandas and Folium for geographic price maps and Matplotlib for statistical charts. 
- GUI Development: Built with Tkinter, allowing predictions, trend analysis, and pdf export. 
2. **Results and Findings:** 
- Model Performance: XGBoost was the best model, with a cross-validation score of 

  0\.562 and the lowest MAE but SVR underperformed and unsuitable for the dataset.**

**Further Studies and Recommendations:** 

- Adding image processing to take a picture of a house and using a CNN model to predict the price with extra information like district, room, region, etc.** 
- Better UI or Web supporting.** 

**Conclusion and Discussion:** 

In conclusion, I worked on models, web scraping, and data preprocessing. I implemented multiple machine learning models, and among them, XGBoost performed the best, meeting our goal of accurate price prediction. Data preprocessing, including cleaning missing values and applying one-hot encoding, helped improve the models' performance. Using Selenium for web scraping allowed us to collect detailed real estate data from sahibinden.com effectively. 

During the project, I faced some challenges, such as scraping dynamically loaded web content, which I solved by using undetected\_chromedriver liblary. Another issue was dealing with missing or inconsistent data, which I addressed by applying data preprocessing. 

This experience taught me the importance of proper data preparation and the challenges of working with real-world data. It also gave me valuable skills in using machine learning models and handling large datasets, which can help in my future projects.
